# Duplicate Image Finder (DIF)
-----------------------------

**Tired of going through all images in a folder and comparing them manually to check if they are duplicates?**
The Duplicate Image Finder (DIF) for Python **automates** this task for you!

-------

Description
-------------

The DIF searches for images in a specified target folder, compares the images it found and checks whether these are duplicates. The DIF then outputs the **image files classified as duplicates** and the **filenames of the images having the lowest resolution**, so you know which of the duplicate images are safe to be deleted. You can then either delete them manually, or let the DIF delete them for you. 

Basic Usage
------------
Use the following function to make DIF search for duplicates in the specified folder:



``hello``

# 1

#1

* test
