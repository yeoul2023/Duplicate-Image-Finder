recursive (bool)
++++++++++++

By default, difPy will search for matching images recursively within the subdirectories of the :ref:`directory` parameter. If set to ``False``, subdirectories will not be scanned.

``True`` = (default) searches recursively through all subdirectories in the directory paths

``False`` = disables recursive search through subdirectories in the directory paths
